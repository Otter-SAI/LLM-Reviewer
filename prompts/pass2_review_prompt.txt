Please perform a global review focusing on:

2.  Sequential numbering of figures, tables, and sections (based on the structural elements provided and your reading of the full text).
3.  Logical flow and coherence between sections.
4.  Any glaring omissions or major structural issues.
Do NOT focus on minor, isolated sentence-level grammar unless it forms a pattern that affects overall understanding, as that was addressed in a prior review pass. Provide your findings as a clear report.
